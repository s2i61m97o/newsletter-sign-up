## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a little about JavaScript regular expressions and how to use one to validate an email input as well as continuing to learn about handling events and using the DOM. 

I also learnt about the picture element for displaying different image for different sized screens. 

### Continued development

I will continue to develop projects that use more JavaScript on the frontend to increase my confidence.
